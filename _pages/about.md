Hello, my name is Rohit Gangurde. I am currently a junior studying Computer Science at Boise State University.
I am interested in all things Machine Learning. I am working on various projects to  fulfill my curiosity and build up my experience. 
I am currently working at the Idaho Transportation Department as a Data Analytics Intern. It's all about Python, SQL and little bit R at my workplace.

Have a look at my profile by browsing through projects and my resume. Feel free to contact me at rohitgangurde@u.boisestate.edu for projects or research work.
