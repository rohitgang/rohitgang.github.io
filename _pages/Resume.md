## Experience
### Micron Technology, Boise
### Engineering Data Analytics Intern
### 05/2020 - 12/2020
> Creating a statistics tool to provide engineers with meaningful insights into the wafer data.

> Working with various volumes of data from multiple sources (frontend wafer test data and backend packaged test
    data) and performing data analysis to identify solutions for engineering problems.
    
> Developing a tool to enable test/product development engineers to group die level data and figure out how the bins
    are yielding in the back-end test flows.
    
### Kloudspot, Boise
### Data Science Intern
### 01/2020 - 05/2020
> Set up pipelines to process user data to readable format.

> Performed cleaning and data manipulation to get rid of the outliers.

> Built and tested models (K-Means, DB-Scan, A = CR [Row space clustering], Random Forest) to find correlations
    between participants in an event.

> Performed dimensionality reduction (PCA reduction) to reduce the size of data while keeping the essential features.
    
### Idaho Transportation Department, Boise     
#### Data Analytics Intern
#### 05/2019 - 12/2019
> Creating custom applications for automation and
reporting purposes. 

> Follow agile life cycle to develop applications.

      feature engineering to increase efficiency of our ML model.


## Research/Projects
#### Trade Direction Classification (research with Dr. Egginton)
#### 09/2019 - Present
    • Classifying Trades as a buy or a sell.
    • Extracting data from different stock markets and parse them.
    • Filtering out features and applying ML models to the dataset.
      Currently using Random Forest Classifier at an accuracy of 
      75% - 86% based on different stock markets. 

#### Twitter Sentiment Analysis (individual project)
#### 09/2019 - Present                   
    • Collecting tweets from Twitter using the twitter api and 
      raspberry pi for 1-3 days.
    • Performing sentiment analysis for certain keywords.
    • Graphing the positive and negative sentiment in realtime.

#### Ada County Housing Analysis (project with a colleague)
#### 08/2019 – Present
    • Scraping the Ada County website for housing  data.
    • Performing data cleaning and manipulation to parse the data
      into desired format.
    • Applying dimensionality reduction techniques and performing
      feature selection.
    • Trying out different ML models and tune hyperparamters for
      efficient performance.

####  ConLL Shared Task 2019 (research with Dr. Kennington) 
#### 05/2019 - Present
    • The goal of the task is to advance data-driven parsing into
      graph-structured representations of sentence 
      meaning.
    • Creating a pipeline to parse the model’s output to a compatible
      form for evaluation.
    • Model in progress and currently has a f1 score of 0.72. Tuning 
      hyperparameters to get better results.

#### Credit Card Fraud Analysis (individual project)
#### 06/2019 – 08/2019
    • Analyzing credit card transaction data obtained from Kaggle for
      any anomalies.
    • Build a K-Means Clustering model to segregate transactions 
      into groups.
    • Used Random Forest Classifier to achieve a    roc_auc_score 
      of 0.918
