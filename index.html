Hi! Welcome to my website. I wanted to greet you with an
image of New York because that's my favourite city! I like 
that New York City is always busy and bustling as that's who I 
am. I like to be busy learning new things. This year has been life-
changing for me. I have dived into machine learning and worked on so 
many projects and doing research work & I want to share that with you.
This website is being updated and will always be updating as I always do something
new. You will find recent posts about my projects below, please 
check them out.
