<p>Welcome. I wanted to greet you with the skyline of New York City because it is always busy and bustling and that's who I 
am. I like to be busy learning new things. This year has been life-
changing for me. I have dived into machine learning and worked on so 
many projects and research work and I want to share that with you.</p>

<p>This website is being updated and will always be updating as I always do something
new. You will find recent posts about my projects below, please 
check them out. To know more about me, click <a href="https://rohitgang.github.io/about/">here</a>. Check out my github profile
